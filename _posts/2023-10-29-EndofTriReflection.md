## Reflection of Trimester 
This trimester was a definite switch for me. Last year I was satisfied with doing the bare minimum and getting the 2.7 or 0.9. This year though I've seen that my perspective and approach has drastically changed as I have been putting more effort really trying to learn. I struggled at first with grasping OOP concepts since I am used to the imperative style, but this trimester has been a great chance for learning. Also I usually reserved to being dev ops or frontend or scrummaster but this year I forced myself to take up a role I wasn't familiar with (backend) and I was able to learn so much. I am really happy with muysefl this trimester and can't wait for the next. Also I think I had a group that struggled at the begining to work together but we pulled off a working product at the end that got great feedback. I am going to work on deploying the AI and making some personalizations on vercel so I add a working link onto my personal portfolio website/linkden. I really enjoyed witnessing everybody's growth this trimester.
